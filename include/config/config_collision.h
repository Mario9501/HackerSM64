// Reduces some find_floor calls, at the cost of some barely noticeable smoothness in Mario's visual movement in a few actions at higher speeds.
// The defined number is the forward speed threshold before the change is active, since it's only noticeable at lower speeds.

// Automatically calculates the optimal collision distance for an object based on its vertices.
#define AUTO_COLLISION_DISTANCE

// Allows objects to use camera distance to determine whether to load collision if the camera is closer than Mario.

// Collision data is the type that the collision system uses. All data by default is stored as an s16, but you may change it to s32.
// Naturally, that would double the size of all collision data, but would allow you to use 32 bit values instead of 16.
// Rooms are s8 in vanilla, but if you somehow have more than 255 rooms, you may raise this number.
// Currently, they *must* say as s8, because the room tables generated by literally anything are explicitly u8 and don't use a macro, making this currently infeasable.
